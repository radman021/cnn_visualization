    This application provides an interactive environment for exploring ResNet strcture.

    From the sidebar, you can navigate to the following pages:

    - **Visualizing Output for Hidden Layers**: View how image propagates through network.
    - **Visualizing Filter Weights**: View convolutional filters at each layer of the network.
    - **Filters as Linear Combinations**: View filters as linear combinations of lower-level filters.
    - **Predict**: Create simple predictions for images and check results.
